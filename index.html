          <p id="paragraph">
            Guess who just got back today? Them wild-eyed boys that had been away Haven't changed,
            had much to say But man, I still think them cats are crazy They were askin' if you were
            around How you was, where you could be found I told 'em you were livin' downtown Drivin'
            all the old men crazy The boys are back in town (the boys are back in town) I said (the
            boys are back in town) (The boys are back in town) The boys are back in town (The boys
            are back in town) The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town) You know that
            chick that used to dance a lot Every night she'd be on the floor, shakin' what she's got
            Man, when I tell you she was cool, she was red-hot I mean, she was steamin' And that
            time over at Johnny's place Well, this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face Man,
            we just fell about the place If that chick don't wanna know, forget her The boys are
            back in town (the boys are back in town) I said (the boys are back in town) (The boys
            are back in town) The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town) The boys are
            back in town (The boys are back in town) Spread the word around Guess who's back in town
            Just spread the word around Friday night they'll be dressed to kill Down at Dino's
            Bar'n'Grill The drink will flow and blood will spill And if the boys wanna fight, you
            better let 'em That jukebox in the corner blastin' out my favorite song The nights are
            getting longer, it won't be long Won't be long 'til summer comes Now that the boys are
            here again The boys are back in town (the boys are back in town) (The boys are back in
            town) (The boys are back in town) The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town)
            spread the word around The boys are back in town (The boys are back in town) The boys
            are back, the boys are back The boys are back in town again Been hangin' down at Dino's
            The boys are back in town again
